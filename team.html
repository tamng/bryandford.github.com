                            <p>Senior in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering Nate is originally from Troy MI, and was introduced to the team by Kathleen in Winter 2012. He loved how it was a smaller tightly knit team, that builds something that floats (usually). This year he will be working with Sara Laffin to build this year’s hull design. Outside of the team Nate is the program chair of the NAME Quarterdeck Society, and a peer mentor the Naval Architecture Engineering 100 section. He also enjoys sailing, drumming and Disc golfing. </p>

                            <p>Gina is a senior in Civil and Environmental Engineering. Looking to get involved in engineering, she joined the Concrete Canoe Team her freshman year. She liked how it didn’t seem like the typical student project team. It’s a lot of fun to see people’s reactions when you tell them that you are on the Concrete Canoe team! This year she will lead Mix Design after two years as Treasurer for MCCT. She is also involved with Intramural Sports and with her church on campus: St Mary’s Student Parish. She is from Carmel, Indiana and is a HUGE Colts fan. </p>

After going to the first few meetings, she loved being involved in a student team and working on the whole canoe design and build process. Working with concrete as a material also presented really exciting and interesting challenges. Most people can't believe concrete can float! She is also a member of the Theta Tau Professional Engineering Fraternity and the Campus Orchestra. She loves baking, photography, and watching endless reruns of How I Met Your Mother.</p>

                            <p>Ben is from the metro-Detroit area, living his entire life in the ever exciting town of Royal Oak, Michigan. He has loved life on the water his entire life, but over the years he lost the sense of danger that it entails. This is what initially drew him to the concrete canoe team, where they build a floating craft out of a brittle, heavy material. This sense of adventure eventually panned into an interest in the group and the entire process. He loves the challenges that making the canoe entails and loves the great friends that he has made in his one year so far on the team. On the team, he has filled the roles of quality control specialist, concrete layer, painter, racer, co-manager of the team twitter account, and many more. Outside of the team, he is involved in the University of Michigan snowboard club, intramural sports, and greek life. His other interests include water sports, music, soccer, and all detroit sports teams (especially the Red Wings). </p>

                            <p>Ryan Meredith is originally from Troy, Michigan and is currently a sophomore in Electrical Engineering. He was first introduced to the team by his brother in Fall 2013 and decided to stay for the fun people and change of pace from his other activities. As head of paddling practice this year, Ryan hopes to teach the team strategies to do the two most important things in canoe racing: going straight and turning (preferably at a fairly fast speed). In his free time, Ryan enjoys playing video games, watching YouTube videos, and listening to music. </p>

                            <p>An honorary engineer by pressure (peer pressure), Zach helped MCCT revamp and refresh their identity in the summer of 2009. A marketer-in-training, Zach helped to raise funds in sponsorships with some local businesses. Although he is gone in body, he is not gone in spirit or artistic freelance work. Zach still helps the team by providing graphic designs for the team's theme, paper, or whatever they e-mail him six weeks out from competition. His humor may be missed, but maybe it isn't because the laughter he provided sometimes halted important canoe production. Anyways, he wishes the team well every year and will always be willing to help out.</p>

                            <p>Zack is a team member that "doesn't fit". A New Jersey native, Zack is one of the few east coast members on the MCC team, but one of the many from the region that attend U of M. Moreover, he isn't the typical concrete canoe teammate. He is (maybe now the only??) Biomedical Engineer on the team, and interestingly enough, has more of an interest in medicine than engineering. Zack joined as a freshman, and this year will be his third year on the team. On a snowy day in March 2011, Zack attended UM for an Engineering Campus Day; during a tour of the Wilson Center, he first saw the concrete canoe team at work. When he realized concrete really can float, he knew he would love to join the team. He plans to continue his role of canoe-design and construction. Last year, he earned the title "Mixmaster" for mixing the cement that made up the canoe on pour day (of course with help). Zack loves music, especially electronic dance music, and sports, and is even an athlete on the University of Michigan Men's Varsity and Club Lacrosse teams. Ultimately, he hopes to bring home some trophies for the Michigan Concrete Canoe team before his time is done. </p>

                            <p>Junior in Chemical Engineering Kim is originally from Ningbo, a city that is located in southeast of China, and is well-known for its fresh seafood. She officially moved to Novi, Michigan this February. She spent three years in Royal Oak for high school. Studying in the US is quite a different experience for her. She gets lots of chance to try new things. Her parents and grandparents used to work in shipyards. Even though she chooses chemical engineering as her major, she inherits her love for watercrafts from her families. So when Concrete Canoe Team came into her sight, she immediately decided to join as a freshman. She loves singing aloud (when no one is around), running and travelling. Her biggest goal is to go backpacking around the world after graduating. </p>

                            <p>Eryn is from the Chicagoland area, more specifically Naperville, IL. She is majoring in Civil and Environmental Engineering but takes special interest in environmental issues. She was introduced to the team by Ben Nagle and was intrigued by the challenges it presents, its adaptability to many of the engineering disciplines, as well as the water aspect. Her favorite place in the world is her family's lake house and she often enjoys spending the day on lake in a kayak. In her spare time she loves to run and has trained for three marathons. She also loves sports, almost of any kind i.e playing soccer, volleyball, snowboarding, wake boarding, and watching football, basketball, and hockey (go Hawks!). </p>
